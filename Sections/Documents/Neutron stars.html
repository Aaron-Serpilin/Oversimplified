        <h1>Neutron stars</h1>
        <p class="AuthorDate">Aaron Serpilin    08-07-2020</p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Neutron stars are the most extreme objects in the universe, only black holes are more extreme but they are not really objects.
            Neutron stars are the densest objects out there and are very useful for studying the universe, in this chapter, we will 
            see one of the variations of neutron stars called a pulsar. These have proven extremely useful for locating galaxies and are 
            used as location points in the cosmos. <br><br>

            If you are ready to have your mind blown away, continue reading the next paragraphs. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Seen in the <a href="Life cycle of stars.html">life cycle of stars</a> chapter, neutron stars are formed when the mass of the core 
            after a star went supernovae belongs to the Chandrasekhar limit. Stars with this mass end their lives with supernovas and the only remnant of them is their 
            squeezed core, which becomes the neutron star. These stars are the densest objects out there and are subject to conditions so 
            extreme that scientists do not know what happens inside of them, they hypothesize that matter in the core of these is a substance 
            called strange matter. Later on we will briefly dive into what this is.
        </p>
        <h3>Size and density</h3>
        <p>
            The size of neutron stars is around 25km^3 or similar to the size of Manhattan but they are 
            incredibly dense, only <a href="Black holes.html">black holes</a> are denser than them. A trillion kilograms or a billion tons would fit
            in a sugar cube made of a neutron star. The density of these objects is of 10^15 grams / cm^3, which means that you could fit 
            half a million Earths in one of them. Here is an image comparing a neutron star with Manhattan:

        </p>
        <h3>Quantum properties</h3>
        <p>
            When stars are near their collapse, their death and final result depends on their mass. The mass of neutron stars are on the 
            verge between ending in a white dwarf or ending in a black hole. So lets find a middle ground between them. The mass of white 
            dwarfs is made up of atoms squeezed together, but they still have their properties. On the other hand, the mass of black 
            holes- if we can call it that way- is made up of atoms ripped apart. Neutron stars are literally made up of what their name is, 
            neutrons. The gravity of these is so strong that it becomes the primary driving force in the quantum world. In the 
            <a href="Quantum mechanics.html"> quantum mechanics</a> chapter, you will see that at those scales, the electromagnetic force is 
            10^31 times stronger than gravity, leaving it basically insignificant. In neutron stars, gravity is stronger. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Parts</h3>
        <p>
            Lets go through each part of a neutron star and explain its properties in each part. <br><br>

            Although neutron stars are stars, they posses a similar structure to planets. They have an atmosphere, a solid crust and a 
            liquid core. <br><br>

            Lets start off with the atmosphere. The atmosphere of up of hydrogen but it is very thin and very hot due to how close it is 
            to the star. Besides that, it is pretty normal, nothing too exciting. <br><br>

            The next part is the solid crust. When the neutron star was a normal star, it went supernovae because it started to use iron 
            as its fuel. Iron is endothermic, which means it can only absorb energy. It does not produce energy through fusion or fission.
            The crust of neutron stars is very compact iron atoms, the gravity of the star makes the nuclei of these to be packed very 
            closely. Here, the orbits of electrons overlap and are not separated as in white dwarfs. But this is the outermost 
            layer of the crust, it has different layers with different properties and names.<br><br>

            At the beginning of the crust, gravity starts getting stronger and now electrons and protons merge together to from 
            only neutrons. If we continue going lower, we will find less protons and electrons as they all merge into neutrons until 
            there are none. In the base of the crust, we have 3 phases. The first one is known as the Gnocchi phase. Lumps of atomic 
            nuclei join in shapes similar to gnocchis and they start to touch. Later we have the Spaghetti phase where these gnocchi 
            shaped lumps rearrange themselves in the form of spaghetti. The last phase is called the Lasagna phase, now instead of having 
            separate threads of atomic nuclei, we find layers of it. If you cannot graph this in your head, here I will leave an image of 
            these phases.

            So we first started at the Gnocchi phase where we found lumps of atomic nuclei packed together, in the spaghetti phase we found 
            lines of atomic nuclei packed together and finally at the end we found the Lasagna phase where atomic nuclei was organized in layers.
            Have in mind that the thickness of the crust is only 1/10 of the radius of the star. If the size of the star is 20km^3, then the crust 
            would only be 1 km thick. The matter that is created by these 3 phases is known as nuclear pasta. This material is thought to be 
            the hardest in the universe, basically indestructible. <br><br>

            Lets compare the constituents of matter at this point with normal atoms. In 1911, a scientist named Ernest Rutherford conducted an 
            experiment where he transmitted a beam through a foil of gold. He was surprised to see that 99.9% of the beams went through the foil,
            this demonstrated that atoms are mostly empty. Most of its mass is in the nucleus and most of its volume is part of the electrons 
            orbit. Why do I recall this experiment? If we transmitted a beam through nuclear pasta, very little to no light would go through it. <br><br>

            Now lets dive into the core. This is the most fascinating part of neutron stars yet the most complex and strangest. The core of 
            neutron stars is liquid, possibly plasma. From now on, everything stated will be a possibility due to the strange nature of 
            matter under these extreme conditions. The core of neutron stars is made up of very dense plasma. One of the possibilities down here 
            is that due to the extreme pressure, atomic nuclei dissolves into quarks. Quarks are in simple terms the atoms of atoms. 
            If this is true, then the plasma in the cores of neutron stars would be known as Quark-Gluon plasma. Stars that have in their cores
            only quarks are known as quark stars, although in the outside they might look just like normal neutron stars. 
            <img class="DocImages" src="Document Images/Neutron stars/Third.jpg"/>

            Once more, if this is true then some of these quarks could change into strange quarks which would create strange matter. Strange matter is a very exotic material 
            with properties very different to our normal matter. In short, strange matter is the most stable matter out there and it is 
            made completely out of quarks. Strange matter is very dangerous because if it exists, there might be particles out there of it 
            that was released when two neutron stars collided. The dangerous part of strange matter is that since it is so stable, 
            normal matter would want to transform into it if they came in touch, therefore changing that constituents of the matter affected.

        <h3>Electromagnetic spectrum</h3>
        <p>
            Neutron stars have the strongest gravity and electromagnetic fields out there after black holes. They are so strong that 
            light bends around it. This has part to do with how hot its surface is, the surface temperature of neutron stars is around 
            a million degrees C or 1000273.15 degrees K. <br><br>

            Neutron stars emit very large amounts of energy per second and their magnetic field is trillions of times stronger than Earth's 
            magnetic field. <br><br>

            Neutron stars primarily emit X-ray and gamma ray radiation. This makes them pretty hard to be detected. Normal neutron stars do not rotate 
            so they are normally like sitting ducks that emit x-ray and gamma ray radiation quietly. Due to how hard it is to detect them, they are normally 
            found at the center of supernovas after they died when they were normal stars. But there are neutron stars that are not that quiet,
            those two types of neutron stars are the ones we are going to see below. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Pulsar</h3>
        <p>
            When neutron stars are recently formed, due to the violent nature of their creation, they normally spin very fast. Some neutron 
            stars spin hundreds of times per second. The fastest rotating pulsar that we know of rotates 700 hundred times per second, or more than a fifth the speed of light.
            Pulsars are basically that, stars that rotate extremely fast and emit light and energy in every direction. Pulsars spin because 
            they keep the momentum that they had when they were normal stars, just that now they are way smaller.
            One way of thinking of pulsars is that they are lighthouses. They constantly spin and emit light but you can only see them 
            when their light points at your direction. This is why pulsars are used as location points in the galaxy. In the 
            <a href="Dark energy.html">dark energy</a> chapter, we will see that pulsars are used to determine the expansion of the universe and 
            to find out how far away a galaxy is from us and how fast it is moving. Here is an image of how a pulsar is: 
            <img class="DocImages" src="Document Images/Neutron stars/Fifth.png"/>
            Image credit: NASA<br><br>

            Due to the rotation of pulsars, they release pulses of light periodically. That is where their name comes from. If you observe them 
            from Earth, you would see a blinking dot in space.<br><br>

            As a matter of fact, when pulsars were discovered in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell at Cambridge, scientists thought that they were some 
            type of technology of super advanced aliens that were trying to communicate with us. Scientists had this conclusion because the 
            pulses were always emitted at the same time, they repeated periodically. Later we discovered that they were simple stars. When 
            Jocelyn discovered pulsars, they also indirectly discovered neutron stars. <br><br>

            Here is a video showing how pulsars rotate, emit radiation and the movements of their gravitational fields:

            The violet rays of light are the pulses that we see. Due to the temperature of neutron stars, when they emit visible light, they
            emit it in the most energetic color of our visible spectrum, violet. That is how we see the pulses of pulsars.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Magnetar</h3>
        <p>
            Magnetars receive their name due to how strong their magnetic field is. The magnetic field of normal neutron stars is a trillion 
            times stronger than Earth, well, the magnetic field of magnetars are 1000 times stronger. This means that it is a quadrillion 
            times stronger than Earth's. Magnetars normally are young pulsars, they spin faster than normal pulsars and have a stronger magnetic 
            field. When they calm down a bit, they become pulsars again. <br><br>

            Do you remember when we went through the parts of a neutron star and we talked about nuclear pasta. Well, due to how energetic 
            nuclear pasta is, it is constrained by the magnetic field of a neutron star and any change in it directly affects the magnetic field.
            The magnetic fields of magnetars is even stronger which means that the crust is under more strain which means it has more energy. In 
            Earth, movements of the mantle releases energy to Earth's crust in the form of earthquakes. In the case of magnetars, when the core made 
            of plasma slightly moves, it causes the crust to release a vast amount of energy. You can compare it with a geyser, it is normally 
            calm hot water but if there is a movement in the mantle or its surroundings, it bursts and releases water and a lot of energy. 
            Here is an image of what this release of energy might look like in a magnetar:
            <img class="DocImages" src="Document Images/Neutron stars/Seventh.jpg"/>
            Image credit: NASA<br><br>

            Just so you realize how much energy we are talking about, a magnetar called SGR 1806-20 had a burst where in one-tenth 
            of a second it released more energy than the sun has emitted in the last 100,000 years. The sun emits in one second 
            more energy that humanity has occupied in all of its existence. Let that idea sink in your mind for a second. <br><br>

        </p>
        <h3>Death of neutron stars</h3>
        <p>
            When neutron stars start aging after billions of years, they eventually slow down. If they do not interact with another star 
            before they cool down completely after emitting energy as gravitational waves and all the types of energy in the 
            electromagnetic spectrum, they will eventually turn into a white dwarf. If they do interact with a star, they will be able 
            to take away some of their mass and turn into a black hole. Remember that neutron stars are in a delicate balance between white dwarfs and 
            black holes. A little more mass or a little less and they will change. <br><br>

            Another alternative is that a neutron star annihilates itself through a kilonova. A kilonova is when two neutron stars 
            or a neutron star and a black hole collide and cause an explosion similar to a supernova but a lot more powerful. If you 
            read in the <a href="Types of stars.html">type of stars</a> chapter, the section of blue stars, you should know that massive 
            stars normally remain at the same spot where they were born due to how massive and how short their lifespan is. Neutron stars 
            only form from massive stars, so it is normal to find binary systems of neutron stars.

            Image credit: space.com<br><br>

            When they collide, the two objects merge and emit gravitational waves and all types of energy all around the galaxies. <br>
            An interesting fact is that on August 14, 2017, gravitational waves observatories Ligo and Virgo detected a kilonova of two neutron stars.
            All other types of observatories detected all the other types of rays. This became the most studied event in the history of astronomy
            and has helped scientists pin down the speed of gravity and help explain the origin of heavy elements such as gold. <br><br>
