        <h1>Life cycle of stars</h1>
        <p class="AuthorDate">Aaron Serpilin 08-28-2020</p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            There are plenty type of stars in the universe as we have seen in the <a href="Types of stars.html">types of stars</a> chapter.
            Remembering all of the types might be a bit difficult, but when we study the life cycle of stars, it becomes easier. There is 
            a basic concept that defines how stars will live, their mass. The mass of a star is the primary variable that will determine its 
            behavior and what it will leave behind.
            <img class="DocImages" src="Document Images/Life cycle of stars/First.jpg"/> <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Stars are astronomical objects of massive proportions held up by their own gravity. They are made up of 
            plasma and are powered in their cores by the fusion of various elements, starting off by light elements and 
            ending in heavier elements. Stars are the fundamental building block of galaxies and make up the most part of
            all ordinary matter in the universe. The closest star to the Earth is the Sun. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>The very beginnings</h3>
        <p>
            Seen in the <a href="Planet formation.html">planet formation</a> chapter, stars form from a gas of cloud named nebulae. 
            Nebulae are formed from the remains of other dead stars and the first ones were originated from the Big Bang itself.
            At the beginning, simple particles of dust join through a force called the van der Waals force. This force is very 
            weak and only works when the collisions are gentle. Once the grains stop being micrometer-sized and become millimeter-sized, 
            their speed increases, therefore the collisions stop being gentle and then this force fails to provide a sufficient amount 
            of stick. When particles become bigger, they also travel faster. We can prove this with the formula of kinetic energy: <br>
            Ke = 1/2 m v^2<br>
            The higher the mass, the higher the speed. This imposes a problem since particles at this size are too small to exert a 
            significant gravitational force, but the particles can slow down due to the gravity of other clumps of dust in the cloud,
            therefore allowing the van der Waals force to take over once again and allow the particles to join and form larger objects.

            There are a couple more processes to become kilometer-sized objects, but once objects become meter sized, 
            they can exert gravity and grow exponentially through a process called accretion.
            Accretion is when particles accumulate by gravitationally attracting other matter, the more massive you are the stronger 
            your gravitational force will be. In the <a href="Planet formation.html">planet formation</a> chapter, we dive in a bit more 
            into some of these processes in case you want to check it out. <br><br>

            Finally matter starts to join into a bigger object, and in about 10 million years, clouds of dust and gases will join 
            and concentrate in dense pockets of gas, this pocket will later start to compress and form an object called a core, this will form a protostar. 
            A protostar is a very small star who is still gathering mass from its cloud. Protostars start as 
            pretty cool and small stars but will gradually grow until its gas cloud evaporates or disappears. 
            In this phase, stars have a strong gravitational force and the remaining gas of cloud 
            around them starts to orbit the star in an object known as a protoplanetary disk, this is where 
            <a href="Planet formation.html">planet formation</a> will take place. Once the protostar gathers 
            enough material, it will start to burn and fuse hydrogen due to its stronger gravity, this next phase of a star is known as a T-Tauri star.
            If a star does not gather enough mass, it will not be able to produce nuclear fusion and it will remain as a brown dwarf, a failed star. 
            Stars that have a similar mass as our sun will take approximately 50 million years to become T-Tauri stars and more massive ones 
            will take less time due to their stronger gravitational force.

        <h3>Star adolescence</h3>
        <p>
            Same as humans, the star adolescence is not pretty either. This phase of a star is known as a T-Tauri star and it is a very 
            important phase. During this phase, T-Tauri stars become an intermediate phase between protostars and main sequence stars. 
            During this phase, these stars exert immense amounts of radiation and solar winds. These solar winds will blow the lighter elements 
            further out into their solar system meanwhile the heaviest will remain closer. Gravity will start contracting the core until the star 
            reaches a zero-age main sequence. This phase is when the star will finally become part of the main sequence, the core of the star will 
            stop contracting and it will find a balance between the exerted energy from its nuclear fusion and its gravity. In this period, stars 
            go through a stage of equilibrium until in the future it will run out of hydrogen. This is why T-Tauri stars are the intermediate between 
            protostars and main sequence stars, they start producing their own energy through fusion and find an equilibrium that will allow them 
            to live for millions of years.

        <h3>Nuclear powerhouse</h3>
        <p>
            Until this point, you have heard nuclear fusion a ton of times and you might not know what it is yet. Nuclear 
            fusion is a process in which normally two light atoms join together and lose some of their mass which is later transformed 
            into energy. Most stars are almost entirely made up of hydrogen, this can vary due to the composition of the nebulae and the 
            protoplanetary disk. Hydrogen is the lightest element in the periodic table, therefore it is common for it to fuse with other 
            atoms of itself. When two protons of hydrogen fuse, one of them decays through a process called beta decay and transforms into 
            a neutron, therefore creating a nuclei made out of a proton and a nuetron. This is called a deutron and when two deutrons 
            join, we obtain a helium nuclei. When two deutrons join or 4 hydrogen nuclei join, they lose 0.7% of their mass which is 
            transformed into energy. Stars go through this process for billions of years until they eventually run out of hydrogen. <br><br>

            When a star fusions a heavier element, it sinks to the core. When a star burns most of its hydrogen, its helium falls into 
            the core and a ring a hydrogen is formed around the core. What happens next depends on the mass of the star. But those who can continue 
            fusing elements will fuse through hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, and finally iron. Once a star reaches 
            iron, it will die. Iron is an endothermic element, which means it cannot produce energy through fusion and fision. After a star 
            reaches this point, it will die because it will not be able to produce enough energy to counteract the gravity.

        <h3>Mass matters</h3>
        <p>
            As I said in the beginning, mass is the main driver of a stars behavior and it determines what it will leave behind. 
            The death of stars varies according to their mass. Low and medium sized stars die and become white dwarfs.  On the other hand, high mass 
            stars can end up in <a href="Neutron stars.html">neutron stars</a> or <a href="Black holes.html">black holes</a>. White dwarfs 
            are seen in the final section of the <a href="Types of stars.html">types of stars</a> chapter. <br><br>

            Stars live in a delicate balance between their gravity, and their outward energy pressure. When a star is more massive, its gravity 
            is stronger which means that it needs to produce more energy to continue being alive. When the outward energy is greater than the gravity, 
            the star expands and becomes a red giants. When the gravity is stronger, it will contract and make the core smaller, therefore producing more energy 
            until it balances off and remains in equilibrium or expands once more. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Low and medium sized stars</h3>
        <p>
            Low and medium sized stars have a rather stable life. During billions of years, they fuse hydrogen into helium and maintain 
            a similar size, color, and temperature. The problems arrive once its hydrogen reserves start to run out. When a star has little 
            hydrogen, it will not produce enough energy to withstand the gravity. Therefore, the core will contract a bit and the temperature 
            inside will increase. The rate of the fusion increases when temperature increases because protons receive a sudden energetic boost 
            and this makes them have a higher motion, making it more likely for them to interact. If a stars temperature doubled, its rate of fusion 
            would be how much times it increased to the fourth power. This means that if a stars temperature doubled, its rate of fusion 
            would increase by a factor of 16 times. Heavier elements need more pressure to fuse, therefore the smaller the core is means that 
            it can fuse heavier elements.<br><br>

            When low and medium sized stars run low of hydrogen, the remaining of it will surround the core as a ring. When stars start to fuse helium, this process is known as helium flash, when the 
            pressure created by the extreme gravity causes helium to fuse. Stars will become swollen during this phase because they will output 
            much more energy due to the higher temperature and higher rate of fusion. Low and medium sized stars become red giants, their diameter 
            becomes several times bigger and since their outer layers are more distant from the core, they become cooler, therefore redder. 
            A star can hold on to this phase for millions or billions of years depending on their mass.

            After low and medium sized stars go through the helium flash and fuse almost all of its helium, its core will be made up of carbon and
            a little bit of oxygen meanwhile it will be surrounded by two thin layers of hydrogen and beneath it helium. At this point the star cannot fuse 
            carbon and oxygen because its mass is too small to create a strong enough gravity. The star will become small and bluer.
            In a last attempt, the core will finally contract and release a last pulse of energy, it will become swollen again. Due to 
            the extreme heat of the core and the pulses of energy, the outer layers will be ejected and will create a planetary nebulae. 
            The remaining object will be the stars core, inside of it will be atoms of carbon and oxygen. The star will not be able to fuse them 
            and will continue to contract until it becomes a degenerate star. This is a state where the electrons have nowhere else to go and 
            the gravity is not strong enough to force them to join the nuclei. When the mass of the remaining core 
            of a star is under the Chandrasekhar limit, it will become a white dwarf. The Chandrasekhar limit is when the mass of the 
            core is less than 1.4 times the mass of our sun. 97% of all stars will end in white dwarfs.

        <h3>High mass stars</h3>
        <p>
            Alright, we covered the baby stars, now lets dive into the big lads. High mass stars go through the same process as low and 
            medium sized stars. The difference is that these stars can fuse carbon and oxygen into heavier elements through a process called 
            the triple alpha process. High mass stars become red giants and after that, they will become red supergiants. These have the 
            same concept as red giants, the core becomes smaller every time due to the stronger gravity in order to fuse heavier elements. High 
            mass stars will fuse all elements until iron. Once they reach iron they will no longer be able to produce more energy. Their core will be 
            made up of iron atoms and surrounded by rings of hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, magnesium, and silicon. The difference with 
            smaller stars is that the gravity of these stars is so strong that they will not eject the outer layers as a planetary nebulae, instead 
            the gravity will contract everything in the core and in a fraction of a second will create a magnificent explosion called a 
            supernovae. The outer layers will bounce off the core and will join with all the heavy elements and the rings around it, this is how 
            heavy elements were created and dispersed throughout the universe. 
            <img class="DocImages" src="Document Images/Life cycle of stars/Eighth.jpg"/>
            Image credit: Sci-News.com<br><br>

            Supernovaes are super energetic events and they can outshine entire galaxies. Think of this, besides hydrogen and helium which were 
            formed during the Big Bang, the rest of elements were created in stars. The carbon in our molecules, the oxygen we breathe, the neon 
            in lasers, the magnesium in our bones, and the silicon in alloys were all made in stars. We can easily say that we, as well as 
            almost everything we know, was made out of stardust. <br><br>

            After supernovae occurs, the only remnant of the massive star is once again its core. There are two possibilities with the cores of 
            massive stars. If the mass of the core belongs to the Chandrasekhar limit, which means that its mass is between 1.4 and 3 times the 
            mass of our sun, it will become a <a href="Neutron stars.html">neutron star</a>, if it is greater than the Chandrasekhar limit, it 
            will become a <a href="Black holes.html">black hole</a>.<br><br>
