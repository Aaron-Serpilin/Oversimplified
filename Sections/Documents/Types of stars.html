        <h1>Types of stars</h1>
        <p class="AuthorDate">Aaron Serpilin    08-02-2020</p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Stars are the most recognized objects in the universe. Stars are a key part of astronomy and astrophysics 
            because mostly everything dates back to them. All heavy elements were made out of stars and even we humans 
            are made out of stardust. <br><br>

           In this document we will analyze the different types of stars, lay out their characteristics and even name 
           a few of them- including our sun.<br><br>
    
        </p>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Stars are astronomical objects of massive proportions held up by their own gravity. They are made up of 
            plasma and are powered in their cores by the fusion of various elements, starting off by light elements and 
            ending in heavier elements. Stars are the fundamental building block of galaxies and make up the most part of
            all ordinary matter in the universe. The closest star to the Earth is the Sun. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Classification</h3>
        <p>
            To avoid confusions, stars will be classified according to the main sequence based on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
            <img class="DocImages" src="Document Images/Types of stars/First.png"/>

            According to the HR diagram, stars can be classified according to their luminosity and color. Although we will not dive in 
            entirely into the Morgan-Keenan system, we will use some concepts of it.The Morgan-Keenan system is another classification
            of stars based on the color of their spectrum. Along the way, we will also mention to what classification stars belong 
            to according to this system.

            The MK system is based on Wien's displacement law that allows us to classify stars based on the temperature of their surface.
            I know, the MK system is based on the color of the spectrum emitted by the star, but the color emitted depends on the 
            temperature of the star. The higher the temperature the bluer, the lower, the redder. <br><br>

            On the other hand, the HR diagram is heavily influenced by the the Russell-Vogt theorem. This theorem states that all the 
            characteristics and parameters of stars are primarily defined by their mass. If you observe the HR diagram, 
            it is based off of the luminosity of stars. Luminosity in short is the brightness of an object, and its formula is <br>
            L = oAT^4<br>
            o is a constant, A the area and T the temperature, The higher the mass of a star, the higher its temperature. 

            The HR diagram shows in the X axis temperature decreasing to the right and in the Y axis luminosity increasing going up.
            Observing the diagram, you can notice that most stars fall in the middle section. This section is called the main sequence, 
            and 90% of all stars fall into this category. From now on, we will classify stars and find out where they are located in both
            classifications.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Brown dwarfs</h3>
        <p>
            Lets start of with brown dwarfs. These objects are not really stars. Many people refer to them as failed stars. Seen in the 
            <a href="Life cycle of stars.html">life cycle of stars</a> chapter, stars are created out of dust clouds. Brown dwarfs were 
            supposed to become stars but they did not obtain enough mass. The mass of brown dwarfs are between 13 and 80 Jupiters. 
            Because of their relatively small mass, the gravity of brown dwarfs does not allow them to perform the fusion of hydrogen,
            although it is thought that if their mass is around 65 jupiter masses, they can fuse deuterium and lithium. Due to the fact that
            they are not stars, they are considered substellar objects. You might think that they are bright but they are not. Brown dwarfs 
            are one of the dimmest objects the universe. They have no solid ground and are made up of gas instead of plasma. In fact, a lot of
            brown dwarfs are often confused with massive planets. <br>
            Their surface temperatures is around 1000 degrees Kelvin or less, due to this they are the only objects in this document that are 
            not part of the HR diagram or the MK system.

            One of the most famous black dwarfs is WISE J1049, the closest one to Earth.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Main Sequence Stars</h3>
        <img class="DocImages" src="Document Images/Types of stars/Fourth.png"/><br><br>
        <h3>Red dwarfs / M type</h3>
        <p>
            Alright, now we can finally get into real stars. Red dwarfs are the smallest possible stars. The difference between them
            and brown dwarfs is that they are actually massive enough to fuse hydrogen and helium. Although they are the smallest 
            stars, about 70% of the stars of the universe are red dwarfs. Their mass ranges between 0.08 and 0.5 or 0.6 times the mass of our 
            sun.<br><br>
            
            What makes red dwarfs really unique is that one day, they may be our last hope for life. The lifetime of red dwarfs is 
            incredibly long, in fact no red dwarf has ever reached its final stage yet, their lifespan is between 1 and 10 trillion
            years. Why is this? More massive stars accumulate the helium in their cores to burn it later, which means they go through 
            hydrogen faster. On the other hand, red dwarfs are convective. Their helium mixes with hydrogen and so they burn slower. 
            The surface temperature of red dwarfs ranges between 2500 and 4000 degrees Kelvin. In the HR diagram, they are found in the 
            bottom right part of the main sequence barely making it. Meanwhile, in the MK system, they are part of M, their main spectrum
            color is red and their temperature does reach 3500 degrees Kelvin. If you are interested in more specs of red dwarfs in the MK
            system, their spectrum is made up of strong neutral metal lines and molecular bands.

            The most famous red dwarf is Proxima Centauri. It is the closest star to Earth at about 4.22 light years away. Due to its 
            proximity, it is likely to be the first star we will ever visit. A program is already under the way by NASA to develop a probe
            that will reach Alpha Centauri in 2069. There are also other private programs, one of the most famous ones is to send hundreds 
            of tiny probes that will be able to travel at 1/5 the speed of light and reach Proxima Centauri in about 20 years.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Orange dwarfs / K type</h3>
        <p>
            Orange dwarfs are the second most common star in the universe, they have a prevalence of approximately 13%.
            The mass of these stars ranges between 0.45 and 0.8 times the mass of our sun. These stars are often known as the 
            perfect stars for extraterrestrial life. <br><br>

            Orange dwarfs are the stars were scientists focus the most to search for extraterrestrial life because of various factors. First of all,
            same as our sun, they have a goldilocks zone- where planets can harbor liquid water. Compared to red dwarfs, orange dwarfs are 
            a lot more stable meaning that they transmit less radiation and they have very long periods of live, ranging between 15 and 40 billion
            years. If you compare that with our star, the sun is nearly halfway through its lifespan and in 1 or 2 billion years, it will grow 
            exponentially into a red giant and make the Earth uninhabitable. This section of stars is seen in the 
            <a href="Life cycle of stars.html">life cycle of stars</a> chapter. Besides this, the mass of orange dwarfs is slightly smaller than
            our sun's mass and is less luminous. This makes it easier for scientists to find other planets (exo-planets) using the radial velocity
            and transit technique. These are topics covered in the <a href="Finding exoplanets.html">finding exoplanets</a> chapter. <br><br>

            Going a bit into the specs of orange dwarfs, as said before they emit less radiation than our sun, nearly 40%, they have lifespans 
            of approximately 15 to 40 billion years, their surface temperature is between 3500 and 5000 K and their main spectrum color is
            orange and in some cases red, which means they belong to the K group in the MK system. Their neutral metal lines are most prominent in their spectrum.
            In the HR diagram, they belong to the main sequence, between red dwarfs and yellow dwarfs.

            Alpha Centauri B is a famous orange dwarf. You might notice that there is a pattern, most famous stars are part of the 
            Alpha Centauri system, and that is true. This is because it is the closest solar system to us. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Yellow dwarf / G type</h3>
        <p>
            Finally we have reached yellow dwarfs, the category to who our sun belongs. There is a pattern in how common stars are and
            you got it right, yellow dwarfs are the third most common type of star in the universe having approximately a 6% prevalence. 
            The mass of these stars can range between 0.8 to 1.25 times the mass of our sun.<br><br>

            Yellow dwarfs can be considered as the most special type of star in the universe because it is the only type of star that we
            know that has been host to life. Compared to the previously seen stars, these have a lifespan between 4 and 17 billion years, our sun
            has a lifespan of 10 billion years. In the MK system, yellow dwarfs belong to the G group, in the MK diagram, the prominent 
            spectrum of the G group is green but the sun is not green. This was made to follow the continuum of colors, our Sun is truly white 
            but due to our atmosphere we see it yellow, although some yellow dwarfs can be yellow. Its spectrum is made up mostly of
            Balmer lines where ionised calcium lines dominate. The surface temperature of these stars can range between 5200 and 7000 K, the 
            temperature of our sun is 5778 K. Just to have an idea of how hot this is, tungsten and rhenium would just start to boil at
            the temperatures reached in these type of stars. These two elements have the highest boiling points of all. Finally, in the HR diagram, these are located in the main sequence between orange and yellow-white 
            dwarfs.

            Here is an image that can sum up a bit the three stars we have seen so far:
            <img  src="Document Images/Types of stars/Eighth.webp"/>

        </p>
        <h3>Yellow-white dwarf / F type</h3>
        <p>
            Yellow-white dwarfs are pretty similar to yellow dwarfs, I mean they share yellow and dwarf in their name. It can be said that 
            yellow-white dwarfs are slightly bigger equivalents to our sun. Their prevalence is 3% and it's mass ranges between 1 and 1.4
            times the mass of our sun. <br><br>

            Yellow-white dwarfs are the third most studied type of stars when it comes to the search of extraterrestrial life. They have a 
            bigger goldilocks zone than our sun and have a very similar spectrum. The only problem with these type of stars is that their solar 
            winds are stronger than our suns and hence transmit more radiation. These stars have a lifetime of approximately 2 to 4 billion years
            and transform quickly into red giants. This shorter life makes it easier to find these type of stars in different parts of their 
            lifespan and helps scientists a lot study stars in later developments. The surface temperature of these are around 6000 and 7600 K. 
            According to the HR diagram, these are located in the main sequence right next to blue stars and after yellow dwarfs. These stars
            can have a blue spectrum for a short period right before transforming into red giants. According to the MK system, these belong to the 
            K group and have a yellow and white spectrum, and might have a late blue spectrum. Their spectrum is made up of weaker Balmer lines, 
            many of these lines include neutral metals. 
            <img class="DocImages" src="Document Images/Types of stars/Ninth.jpg"/>

            The most famous yellow-white dwarf is Polaris. This star has always marked the way due North, travelers and compasses always centered
            it at that location. If you live in the Northern hemisphere and you look North you will find it, besides it is pretty shiny. The reason 
            why this star has always served as a direction guider is because it is located right above the North pole, that is why it seems to 
            remain still why the Northern sky revolves around it.<br><br>
            
        </p>
        <h3>Light blue-white stars / A type</h3>
        <p>
            Out of the three main sequence types of blue stars- because there are two other types in the giants section below-, the A 
            type are the smallest. The prevalence of these stars is around 0.6% and are pretty easy to see in the sky due to 
            their luminosity. <br><br>

            Light blue stars are really massive stars, this is where things start to get really interesting. The mass of these stars ranges 
            between 1.4 and 2.1 times the mass of our sun. Unfortunately they cannot turn into <a href="Black holes.html">black holes</a>
            ,but once they die, they can turn into neutron stars. The temperatures of these stars range between 7500 and 10000 K, they are so 
            hot that they reach the second most energetic color of our visible light spectrum, blue. These stars burn through their fuel extremely fast
            and can only last approximately 1 billion years. In the main HR diagram, these stars are located in the middle left part, they are big 
            but what goes after them are still way bigger. In the MK system, these are part of the A group. Their spectrum is normally light blue 
            although it can also be white. previously when we mentioned the composition of the spectrum, we mentioned Balmer lines plenty of times,
            well, these stars have the strongest Balmer lines and also have other strong lines. 
            <img class="DocImages" src="Document Images/Types of stars/Tenth.jpg"/>

            The most famous light blue-white star is Sirius A. A fun fact is that this is the brightest star that we can observe 
            in the night sky since it is only 8.6 light years away. It is also known as the Dog Star and it is part of a binary system 
            with a white dwarf called Sirius B. <br><br>


        </p>
        <h3>Blue stars / B type</h3>
        <p>
            If the conditions before were extreme, not its even worse. At this stage, stars are too massive that they normally die where 
            they are created. That is why it is very common to find O and B stars very close to each other, because they are too massive 
            and do not live long enough to move somewhere else. Blue stars are very, ver rare, their prevalence is only 0.13%. 
            Some of these stars can be considered blue giants or blue supergiants.<br><br>

            Blue stars are the second biggest type of stars that belongs to the main sequence. The temperature of these stars ranges between
            10000 and 30000 K, and due to the extreme heat it is safe to say that half of it or even more is ionized helium or hydrogen, 
            this means that the neutral atoms or molecules of this star have a charge due to the removal of electrons. The mass of these is a bit
            difficult to pin point because not all of scientists agree, but it ranges between 2 and 15 or 20 solar masses. Due to its high mass and 
            scorching temperatures, these stars do not live very long and normally live for 40 million years. This is why I said at the beginning 
            that these stars normally die wherever they are created. In the HR diagram, these are right below the blue giants at the upper left part
            . On the other hand, in the MK system, these are in the B group - by the way, it is a coincidence that they are blue and they are in the 
            B group. The spectrum is characterized by absorption lines of neutral or singly ionized helium with lines of atomic hydrogen.

            One of the most famous blue stars is Spica, the brightest star in the Virgo constellation and the 16th brightest star in the 
            night sky.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Violet- dark blue stars / O type</h3>
        <p>
            We have finally reached the last type of stars of the main sequence, violet or dark blue stars. If you were impressed by 
            blue stars, you were impressed by the fifth part of violet- dark blue stars. To avoid repeating violet- dark blue a lot, 
            I will simply refer to these stars as O stars. These stars are the biggest stars in the main sequence  The prevalence of 
            these is only of 0.00003%.<br><br>

            O stars are fascinating, they are very massive but not giants yet. Their mass lies between 16 and 40 solar masses, but they are 
            more than a million times more luminous that our sun. I gave a small sneak peek in the beginning saying that blue stars are 
            the fifth part of O stars, and if we speak about emitted energy, that would be true. O stars emit 5 times more energy than blue 
            stars. The temperature of these stars is about 40000 K, although it can range between 28000 and 50000 K, that is nearly 10 times the 
            temperature of our sun. Blue stars had very high temperatures and because of that had a lot of ionized helium and hydrogen, but in O stars,
            almost all or all of its helium and hydrogen is ionized. Due to this, if we check out its spectrum using the MK system, we find out 
            that it is made up of weak Balmer lines, few visible absorption lines and ionized helium lines. But wait, there is one downsides to this,
            due to how massive these stars are, they live around 4 to 6 million years. These spectacular monsters do not live that long, and 
            due to that normally die at the same place where they were created. But there is a good side, O stars almost always end up in 
            supernovas and leave behind beautiful nebulas. In the HR diagram they are at the very top left part right beneath or parallel to 
            the blue giants.

            Image credit: forums.frontier.co.uk<br><br>

            The most famous O star is Alnitak Aa, it is the brightest O type star in the night sky and is located in the Orion belt.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Below you will find a small chart made by J. C. Evans from George Mason University where he summed up everything we have seen
            so far. The colors given in the chart are references but the colors mentioned earlier are the ones you should have in mind.
            <img class="DocImages" src="Document Images/Types of stars/Thirteenth.png"/><br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Giants and SuperGiants</h3>
        <p>
            Finally we have reached the Giants zone. We will not have a scrutiny as in depth as the main sequence stars in this section
            because giants are in short the same as normal stars- with the same color spectrum- but more massive. 
            We will only look into the general details of them. <br><br>

            Just as a highlight, all stars of the main sequence become giants when they are dying. Stars are not - normally- born with 
            the mass of giants, but they transform into them since their core contracts and their outer layers expand. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Blue giants</h3> 
        <p>
            The spectral types of blue giants can vary, they can be either O, B or A. These stars are super massive, their mass is between 
            2 and 10 times the mass of our sun, consequently they are extremely hot, their surface temperature ranges between 
            10000 and 33000 K. Having this in mind, they burn through their fuel of hydrogen very fast and they approximately last between
            10 and 100 million years. There is a bunch of terms that are related to blue giants, but you must have in mind that to be 
            considered a blue giant, they must have at least a surface temperature of 10000 K. Blue giants burn hydrogen, but once they run 
            out and start using helium, they transform into red giants. Seen in the <a href="Life cycle of stars.html"> life cycle of stars</a> 
            chapter, due to the mass of these, blue giants can either end in neutron stars or in <a href="Black holes.html">black holes.</a>
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Blue supergiants</h3>
        <p>
            Now we dive into the blue supergiants. In this case, blue supergiants can only have an O or B spectral type and their 
            surface temperature ranges between 20000 and 50000 K. They are basically the same as blue giants but bigger. Blue supergiants 
            cannot last longer than 10 million years, they go through their fuel to quickly to last any longer. The mass of these on the 
            other hand is around 20 and 25 times the mass of our sun. In the <a href="Life cycle of stars.html">life cycle of stars</a> chapter,
            we saw that stars that have a mass 3 times greater than the sun can end up in <a href="Black holes.html">black holes.</a> The curious 
            thing about blue supergiants is that they are so big that sometimes they do not become black holes and they simply evaporate. 
            I bet that would be cool to watch. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Red giants</h3>
        <p>
            Red giants are very interesting, they are extremely big but are very cool and dim. Out of all the giants, they are the most common
            ones with a prevalence of 0.4% of all stars. The spectral types of these are M and K. Their mass ranges between 0.3 and 8 times the mass of our
            sun. The cool thing of red giants is that they only appear at the end of the lifespan of main sequence stars. When stars are 
            starting to run dry on their hydrogen reserves and start burning heavier elements, they become red giants. The mass of red giants
            can become 100 times more than the mass of their original stage. The difference between red giants and blue giants is that
            these can last between millions and billions of years, the more massive the sooner they will die.
            The surface temperature of these ranges between 3300 and 5300 K. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3> Red supergiants</h3>
        <p>
            I will use the same analogy as in blue supergiants, they are the same as red giants but bigger. The prevalence of these is 
            even less, they have a 0.0001%. If you look at 1 million stars, you will always find at least one red supergiant. These stars
            are the biggest things in the universe, but they are not the most luminous or the more massive. The most massive objects are
            dead stars and the most luminous belongs to blue supergiants. Their mass is around 10 and 40 times the mass of our sun, 
            and have a surface temperature between 3500 and 4500 K. They are so big because  when they start burning heavier elements, 
            their outer layers expand hugely. <br.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Dead stars</h3>
        <p> 
            Dead stars are created when the thermonuclear fusion in the cores of stars stops producing energy and they either collapse or
            end up in different results seen below. I highly recommend to check out the 
            <a href="Life cycle of stars.html">life cycle of stars</a> section to understand how these are formed in the first place.

        <h3>White dwarfs</h3>
        <p>
            White dwarfs will probably be the last source of energy in the universe. In simple terms, they are the corpses of small and 
            medium stars. All stars whose remnant core's mass is under the Chandrasekhar limit will eventually turn into white dwarfs. In fact, 97% of 
            all the stars in the universe will turn into white dwarfs at one point, including our own sun. White dwarfs are the 
            remaining cores of dead stars.<br><br>

            White dwarfs are very strange objects, they do not collapse due to their gravity because it is not strong enough but they do not 
            emit external pressure to counter gravity. This causes the atoms to be sticked as close as possible. Here is where the 
            Pauli Exclusion Principle occurs. The orbits of electrons of a single atom overlap, something that would be impossible under 
            normal circumstances. You might ask why does not a white dwarf collapse if it does not produce external pressure. The answer 
            has to do with <a href="Quantum mechanics.html">quantum mechanics</a>. A white dwarf is considered a degenerate star because it has degenerate gas, this means that 
            the electrons of its atoms fill up all of its energy levels. So, when gravity tries to squeeze the electrons further and fuse with 
            with the nuclei as in <a href="Neutron stars.html">neutron stars</a>, they cannot because the electrons do not have anywhere else 
            to go. <br><br>

            White dwarfs are one of the densest objects in the universe, a tea spoon of it has roughly the same mass as a car. Normally 
            the size of these is similar to the size of the Earth, but they are much denser since they end up with approximately half the 
            mass of their original stage. Due to its high density, it has a very high gravity, about 100000 times the gravity of Earth. I 
            know I mentioned earlier that red dwarfs might be the last hope for life for humanity, but white dwarfs too. They are one of the hottest 
            objects in the universe, in some cases being 40 times hotter than our sun. They are not 
            convective but the way in which they release energy is also extremely ineffective. Due to the gravity of them and how close atoms 
            are, particles cannot escape. Only some particles in the outer layers can but since space is basically empty, heat cannot be 
            conducted. This means that the only way that white dwarfs can release energy is by thermal radiation. This process will take trillions of years.
            Having this in mind, white dwarfs will live for a very long time and are incredibly stable due to how little energy can escape from it.
            We have found something in common, <a href="Black holes.html">black holes</a>, red dwarfs and white dwarfs are extremely ineffective at dying. <br><br>

            White dwarfs also have a structure, they have en extremely thin atmosphere made up mostly of hydrogen and helium. In fact, this 
            atmosphere is so thin that a skyscraper would be higher than it. Under the atmosphere we find a 50km thick crust. At the bottom of it,
            we find a layer of crystalline lattice of carbon and oxygen atoms. Since diamonds are made out of crystallized carbon atoms, it 
            could be possible that it is made up of diamonds. <br><br>

            White dwarfs can die in two ways, either they absorb mass from a nearby star and end in a supernovae or they eventually run 
            out of energy and turn into a black dwarf.

        <h3>Black dwarfs</h3>
        <p>
            Due to the age of our universe, around 14 billion years, no white dwarf has had enough time yet to die and become a 
            theoretical black dwarf. Due to this fact, black dwarfs are only hypothesis that we will never be able to confirm in our 
            lifetime. <br><br>

            Black dwarfs are the remnants of white dwarfs. They are inactive spheres that can no longer transmit energy. They are 
            part of the reason why the universe will someday die. When stars die, they either release a planetary nebula a supernovae. 
            A great part of its mass is released but some of it remains trapped in its core. White dwarfs at least emit radiation, 
            therefore create energy. Black dwarfs are trapped matter that cannot go anywhere or produce any energy, they just exist. 
            There are two hypothesis for the death of black dwarfs. <br><br>

            The first one is that after 10^30 years or a nonillion years, the proton will start to decay and the very structure of matter 
            will lose its integrity. Black dwarfs are just clumps of matter destined to disappear one day and not influence the universe.
            Atoms will be ripped apart and not only black dwarfs, but the universe in general will die. This death of the universe is called 
            the big freeze, and it comes after its heat death due to black dwarfs. <br><br>

            The other possibility is that before this happens, the atoms of black dwarfs will become iron atoms, therefore created a sphere the 
            size of Earth made out of iron. This process is known as quantum tunneling and it will take so long that you might as well cal it forever.
