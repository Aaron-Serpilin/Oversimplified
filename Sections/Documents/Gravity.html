        <h1>Gravity</h1>
        <p class="AuthorDate">Aaron Serpilin 08-25-2020</p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Gravity is one of the 4 most important forces in the universe, yet there are several things about it we still do not 
            understand. Everything that has mass produces gravity, even us humans. But does all gravity come out of mass? In the 
            <a href="Dark matter.html">dark matter</a> chapter, we have seen that this quote is driving several astronomers mad. 
            In the large scale of the universe, gravity is the most important force, even though it is the weakest. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Gravity is the primary driver of star cycles, planetary motion, and galactic evolution. It is the most impactful force 
            in the large-scale structure of the universe. Basically without gravity-no matter where it came from- the universe 
            would have been a giant empty void where you would find an atom every billion kilometers( this is not to scale.) Gravity 
            is the binding force of the universe, it is what allows mass to join and what creates all the structures we have ever known. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Gravity and the other forces</h3>
        <p>
            Gravity is a strange force. Although it is the most impactful force at large scale, it is also the weakest. 
            This might sound a bit counter intuitive but it is even hard for astronomers to grasp it. The electromagnetic force 
            is 10^36 times stronger than gravity. The four main driving forces of the universe are: <br><br>
            -Gravity<br>
            -Electromagnetic force <br>
            -Strong nuclear force <br>
            -Weak nuclear force <br><br>
            What truly draws the line between gravity and the other forces is how it interacts with matter. All the other forces interact 
            through some particles. The electromagnetic through bosons, the strong force through hadrons, and the weak force through fermions.
            Until this day, scientists have not found yet a particle through which gravity interacts. Because the other forces do interact through 
            particles, scientists assumed that gravity interacts through a particle called the graviton. Until this day we have not been able to 
            prove that. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Newtonian gravity</h3>
        <p>
            In the 1600s, Isaac Newton and Galileo Galilei pieced together a theory of gravity. This is one of the earliest, if not the first, 
            approach to understanding forces. Later on in 1915 Einstein put forward his <a href="General relativity.html">general realtivity</a>
            theory that complimented and expanded Newton's theory. I think that everybody has heard about Newton, and that his idea of gravity 
            was based on his observation of an apple that fell on his head. When this happened, a light sparked in Newton's head. He understood 
            that the same force that brought the apple down was the force that prevented the Moon to crash Earth and the Earth to fall into the 
            Sun. Finally this force had a name: Gravity. <br><br>

            Newton's universal law of gravity states that the more massive something is, the stronger its gravity will be, and the further away 
            the two objects are from their center, the weaker. This statement can be proved with a simple equation: <br>
            Fg = G m1 m2 / r^2 <br>
            G is equal to the gravitational constant, meanwhile m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects and r is the radius between the two. 
            Lets use this formula and figure out the gravitational force that the sun exerts on our planet: <br><br>

            Gravitational constant = 6.67 x 10^-11 m^3 / kgs^2 <br>
            Mass of the Earth = 5.97 x 10^24 kg <br>
            Mass of the Sun = 1.99 x 10^30 kg <br>
            Average radius between the two = 1.5 x 10^11 m <br><br>

            After a bunch of multiplications and divisions we find out that the gravitational force of the sun on Earth is  <br>
            Fg = 3.5 x 10^22 N (Newtons)

            A curious fact about Newton's gravity equation is that it is the same equation used to calculate the electromagnetic force. 
            The equation for the electromagnetic force is: <br>
            Fe = Ke q1 q2 / r^2 <br>
            The constant and the values change, but the principle is the same. This is how scientists know that the electromagnetic force 
            is way stronger, they compare the force in relation to the mass. <br><br>


        </p>
        <h3>Einstein's gravity</h3>
        <p>
            Einstein put forward his general relativity theory back in 1915. In this theory he expanded on Newton's works and gave gravity 
            an entirely new meaning. In contrast to Newton, Einstein saw gravity not as a force but as a distortion of space and time itself.

            This image is <a href="General relativity.html">general relativity </a> simplified in a two dimensional realm. If we were seeing Newton's 
            idea of gravity we would see an object emitting gravitational waves. Einstein, on the other hand, saw gravity as the effect of the warping 
            of the geometry of space and time. Places with high concentrations of mass and energy (they are the same thing) cause sort of dips in 
            space. The more massive or energetic something is, the bigger the dip will be. That is why the dip of 
            <a href="Black holes.html">black holes</a> is so deep. If you have taken calculus, this dip might remind you to infinite limits.
            Due to the nature of those dips, nothing can escape it.  <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Orbits</h3>
        <p>
            If you have seen the <a href="Planet formation.html">planet formation</a> chapter, orbits were one of the focus of analysis there 
            due to how it influences a planet. Once we learn Newton's gravity equation, we might start to understand why the gravitational force 
            of the sun is weaker on Pluto and stronger on Mercury. The planets further out of the solar system have a greater radius therefore the 
            gravitational force of the Sun is weaker. This statement is half true. If all the planets had the same mass, then yes this would happen. 
            According to our understanding of planet formation, the further out planets are the more massive they become. Remember that the more 
            massive an object is the stronger the force is too. <br><br>

            Using Newton's formula, the gravitational force of the sun on Saturn is of 3.67 x 10^28 N, it is greater than Earth's influence. <br><br>

        </p>
        <h3>Gravity in stars</h3>
        <p>
            In any chapter that is related to stars, you might have heard that gravity is key in star cycles. In the introduction I stated 
            that as well. The reason is because of thermonuclear fusion. Stars are gigantic nuclear powerhouses that produce energy through this 
            process. <br><br>

            Stars live in a very delicate balance between their outputted energy and their gravity. The more massive a star is, the stronger 
            its gravity will be. This means that if a star is more massive it needs to produce more energy to maintain this balance and therefore goes through its reserves 
            of elements faster. Stars start off fusing hydrogen into helium, once they run out of hydrogen they fuse helium into carbon. 
            Every time a star burns a different element, its core contracts. When the core of a star contracts, it submits its elements to more 
            pressure and gravity and makes them produce more energy. Seen in the <a href="Life cycle of stars.html">life cycle of stars</a> chapter, main 
            sequence stars turn into red giants due to this reason.

            This image sums up a bit how gravity works in a star. <br><br>

            This is why gravity is a key part of star cycles. The more massive a star is means that it has stronger gravity, this makes the star 
            live less and die younger. <br><br>

            A fun fact about the gravity and the orbits of stars is that stars constantly lose mass through solar winds and when they transmit energy. 
            We know that the more massive a star its, the more gravity it produces. If a star loses a lot of mass in a span of a couple millions 
            or billions of years, then its gravitational force will be weaker and the orbits of its planets will slowly go further away. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Tidal forces</h3>
        <p>
            Tidal forces are a sort of distortion caused by massive objects to one another due to the gravitational pull of each other. 
            Have you ever heard that the tides on Earth rise due to the moon? Well this is true, and it does not only happen during a full moon. 
            <br><br>

            Imagine the moon and Earth as a rubber ball that you can squeeze and stretch. The gravitational interaction between the two of them 
            causes this effect to one another. The reason why the tides rise during the night is because of the distortion the moon causes on the 
            Earth, its gravity pulls Earth's surface towards it and causes its land and seas to rise 0.5 meters. But this does not only happen 
            here on Earth. Io is a moon of Jupiter, it is the most volcanically active place in our solar system. <br><br>

            Io was a very important discovery by astronomers because it showed us that planets and moons can have other energy sources besides the 
            Sun or other stars. Due to the immense gravity of Jupiter and another of its moons, Europa, Io is being constantly squeezed and stretched. 
            This constant pull and push flexes the moon and creates heat inside of it causing it to release it through its volcanoes. <br><br>
