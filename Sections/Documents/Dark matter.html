        <h1>Dark matter</h1> 
        <p class="AuthorDate">Aaron Serpilin 08-11-2020</p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            I want to start off saying that the name that scientists gave dark matter is very misleading. We humans have a tendency to name 
            stuff we do not understand or know about to pretend that we in fact do understand it. Dark matter is not matter, in fact we have no 
            idea what it is. Dark matter is a source of gravity in the universe that has maintained the complex structures of the cosmos together.
            It should really be called dark gravity, but the name has stuck for nearly 100 years. Nearly 27% of the universe is dark matter.  <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Referencing back to the introduction, dark matter is a solution to a "missing mass" problem in the universe. We will dive into 
            how it was firstly proposed a bit later. Dark matter is a source of gravity in the universe that has prevented the most complex and 
            largest structures to separate, it has bonded them together. Dark matter has no direct influence on the micro scale, it is insignificant 
            to planets but it is relevant to larger scale objects such as galaxies. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            In 1937, a Swiss-American astrophysicist called Fritz Zwicky started to analyze the movements of galaxies in a supercluster 
            called the Coma Berenices, or more commonly known as the Coma cluster. Seen in the <a href="Gravity.html">gravity</a> chapter, 
            planets orbit a massive object-a star- at the center of their solar system due to the gravitational force exerted by it. The 
            same thing happens at larger scales, solar systems orbit a super massive black hole at the center of galaxies and galaxies 
            that belong to clusters and superclusters have been observed to orbit something at the center too. Once more, we have no clue what 
            that something is. Dark matter has remained as the longest unsolved mystery in astrophysics, astronomy and cosmology.

            When analyzing the galaxies, Zwicky had in mind two principles of Newtonian gravity. First of all he considered the force of gravity 
            formula: <br>
            Fg = Gm1m2 / r^2<br>
            This formula states that the further away an object is from the object it orbits, the slowest it moves because its gravitational 
            force is weaker. The other principle he had in mind was escape velocities. Escape velocities are certain speeds that an object 
            requires to exit its gravitational orbit. We saw in the <a href="Black holes.html">black holes</a> chapter that the escape velocity 
            to escape the event horizon is the speed of light. On the other hand, if we multiplied Earth's orbital speed to the square root of 2,
            Earth would achieve escape velocity and leave the solar system. <br><br>

            Using these two principles, Zwicky realized two things. First, that the outermost galaxies was moving as fast or even faster than the 
            innermost galaxies. This was a shocking reveal because according to the laws of gravity we know, this was not possible.
            Scientists started to doubt Newton's equations and Einstein's <a href="General relativity.html">general relativity</a>. 
            Second of all, most galaxies of the Coma cluster were traveling faster than their escape velocity. This was more mind blowing
            -at least for me- than the first problem. The galaxies of the cluster should have started to fly apart and in a hundred million 
            years leave no trace of their existence, only a giant space, but the cluster was ten billion years old. <br><br>

            Scientists started looking for the missing mass that would answer the huge gravitational force that was coming out of nowhere. Of 
            course, they found nothing and they named this missing matter "dark matter". They supposed it manifested itself in some strange form 
            that would later be discovered, but until this day we have no clue.<br><br>

            On top of that, in 1976, an astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Vera Rubin discovered a similar mass anomaly in 
            spiral galaxies. She noticed that in the edge of galaxies luminous disk, stars had incredibly high orbital speeds. In those places, 
            there is too little matter to explain the high orbital speeds of stars. Those parts of galaxies are made up of some isolated gas clouds
            and a few bright stars. These objects were used as tracers of the gravity field where there was not enough matter to exert such.
            Rubin reasoned that in fact there must be some kind of dark matter in those far-out regions where there is basically no matter. 
            These zones were denominated as "dark matter haloes." <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Effects</h3>
        <p>
            Dark matter cannot be seen. Light bends around it, therefore dark matter does not interact with light. We have a similar problem 
            between dark matter and gravity. We can clearly see its effects but we cannot see it. If we could not see the effects of dark matter 
            then it would truly be made up, but we can. <br><br>

            Remember that I said earlier that dark matter does not directly influence us? Well without it we would not be alive. We will dive 
            in a bit into the <a href="History of the universe.html">history of the universe</a> to explain why. <br>
            During the first half million years of the big bang, the universe was a very unstable place. Its temperature constantly rose 
            and dropped substantially. At one point, electrons joined with atomic nuclei and left behind all the photons that today compress 
            what we know as visible light. The first atoms were created. After this, atoms started joining through electromagnetic force 
            and later on through gravity and formed the very first structures. We had the first matter, but during the next half million years
            the universe continued expanding at an incredible rate, doubling in size. The nature of the universe was -and still is- to expand. 
            Gravity tries to join stuff but the universe tries to separate them. If you compared the mass and the size of the universe and made 
            the math, you would realize that matter would lose this battle and start separating. No clusters, galaxies, systems, stars, planets 
            or people would have every formed. Thankfully dark matter helped and made matter stick together.

            If you made the calculations you would find that the gravity needed from dark matter to accomplish this is six times greater than 
            all the gravity produced by normal matter. This value remains until today when we analyze the movements of galaxies. 
            For simplistic reasons, scientists normally say that 85% of the gravity in the universe is produced by dark matter instead of 
            saying that dark matter produces six times more gravity than normal matter. Now, this value does not tell us what dark 
            matter is, it only tells us its effect and proves to us that it exists. <br><br>

            Lets talk about its effects in a smaller scale, without dark matter it would be almost impossible to have clusters since 
            their orbital speed would kick them out of their orbit. The same could be said of solar systems in galaxies, galaxies would be 
            emptier. Dark matter is necessary to explain the motions of stars around the center of galaxies.
            So we can drive a conclusion out of this. Without dark matter clusters and galaxies would be much emptier. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>What it might be</h3>
        <p>
            So we understand what dark matter does and we are sure it exists. No doubt. But what is it? I kind of think of this problem 
            as trying to see and invisible elephant in the living room. Lets start by saying what it is not sine we know way more what 
            it is not rather than what it is. Lets enlist them: <br> <br>
            1. It is not a product of black holes because we would have detected their gravitational effects near stars. <br>
            2. It is not dark clouds because they would absorb or interact with light. <br>
            3. It is not rogue interstellar objects since it would be unlikely or impossible for the universe to produce 6 times more mass
            in the form of planets in comparison to stars. If this were true, these objects would not produce light, therefore they could 
            not be stars. <br>
            4. It is not made of normal matter or atoms since it does not interact with the strong or weak nuclear force. <br>
            5. It cannot be concentrations of particles since it does not interact with the electromagnetic force, therefore it cannot 
            join in clumps. Actually all the dark matter that we know is widely spread. In contrast to normal matter, the particles or whatever 
            dark matter is made of, do not join. If it were made out of atoms, we found find an atom of it every several meters.

            In this image, the blue part shows the distribution of mass in the Abell 2744 cluster. The blue part is mostly dark matter. <br><br>

            You might ask why I mentioned the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force. These 3 forces 
            plus gravity make up the 4 basic forces of the universe, the 4 forces with which the universe was created. All normal matter 
            is supposed to interact with them. <br><br>

            Well, basically dark matter cannot be anything. Lets dive into what it might be. <br><br>

            Particle physicists are confident that dark matter is made up of some kind of exotic undiscovered type of particle. They 
            assure that this particle only interacts with matter through gravity and does not interact with light and matter directly 
            or very weakly. Scientists use neutrinos as an example of how we might discover the particles of dark matter. Neutrinos 
            are the smallest elementary particle we know about. It has no charge and it it still debated if it has any mass at all. The 
            interaction of neutrinos with mass is almost none. In fact, if you expose yourself to the sun for a second, millions of 
            neutrinos will have went through your body without you even noticing it. That is how insignificant they are. You might wonder 
            what does this have to do with anything. Neutrinos were discovered in 1956 by Fred Reines when he noticed that when a nucleus 
            is going through beta decay, it emits a neutrino with an electron. Later on, scientists discovered that when neutrinos interact 
            with an atom of gallium-71, it converts it into germanium-71. The point is that these particles have an insignificant interaction with 
            matter and perhaps the particles of dark matter are the same. We just need to find out how and with what they interact.<br><br>

            Particle physicists are so desperate to discover dark matter particles that they have even created the world's largest particle 
            accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, to try to create dark matter particles.<br><br>

            Now there are a bunch of theories of dark matter, mus of them evolve around the thought that dark matter particles belong to the 
            WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles). But there is one other theory that I would like to recall. This is the theory that I 
            would like to be true. It is that dark matter is simply gravity from another universe that is leaking into our universe. This leads
            to the theoreticized multiverse. This idea does sound a bit far fetched but give it a shot. Gravity can escape our universe, this has 
            been already been proven. Following this principle,perhaps dark matter is not matter at all and is just leaking gravity. Our neighbor
            universe would have to be way more massive than ours but it could work. <br><br>

            Due to the nature of dark matter, this chapter has been full of speculation but it is what it is. We know very little about 
            the main source of gravity of our universe, basically nothing. <br><br>
